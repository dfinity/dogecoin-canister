## Overview
The Dogecoin canister is the core component of the Dogecoin integration project. It enables other canisters deployed on the Internet Computer to use Dogecoin and interact with the Dogecoin network.

To this end, it provides a low-level API with a small set of functions, which serve as the foundation to build powerful Dogecoin libraries and other development tools, and Dogecoin smart contracts running on the Internet Computer.
